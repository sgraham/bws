Boxes Wot Shoot - Scott Graham 2011 - http://h4ck3r.net/
--------------------------------------------------------

You are a Box. Wot Shoots. And you need to... yes, that's right shoot! To score
points and then achieve The Not Dying.


Needs Gamepad API, which as of this writing you can get in Chrome or Firefox.

And, audio is Web Audio only (sorry, I couldn't get the others to work
reliably).

Also needs a moderately decent video card for WebGL to not suck too much.

Keys
--------------------------------------------------------

R - reset the gamepad settings

examples.
